For Reference I have added the excel file on how it should actually look for this script to be usable 
I have added the other python script as well where vice versa will be taking place like what If I want to update only the API names in the metadata file based on the mapping
that I have in my excel.[For this scenario I have two Python Scrips just check ones which ones are working for you]


and make sure for the Python script to function properly all the necessary libraries and packages are installed in your Visual Studios


IMPORTANT POINTS

1. Make sure u have all the necessary libraries and packages installed present in the Code
2. Format the excel as Column A [API_Name]  and Column B [Label]
3. Rename the existing(The metadata file you want to update) Metadata File as Account.object
4. Make sure you have placed all the files in correct directory 
5. Run the file in your VS Code terminal


Enjoy !!!
